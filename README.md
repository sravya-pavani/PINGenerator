# PINGenerator

## Overview

* This is a sample application based on ASP.NET MVC that generates random 4-digit PINs.
* The application takes the number of PINs to generate(between 1 to 5) as input from UI.
* User can generate many PINs and emit all of them at once.
   * For example, user can generate 4 PINs first time and can generate 3 PINs next and when emit is clicked, all 7 PINs are displayed. 
* Once the application is run, open the url http://127.0.0.1:8081 to view the web page and perform generate and emit operations.
